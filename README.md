# bearr-theme-features

A WordPress companion plugin that adds features to all ThemeBear WordPress themes, like new elements, custom post types and custom fields.

It also adds new elements that can be used with shortcodes or using King Composer Page Builder. 

They only work with Themebear themes because they need CSS and settings that vary by theme.

**New Elements**
- Blogroll
- Clients Carousel
- Countdown
- Gallery
- Gridblog
- Portfolio
- Quover 
- Restaurant Elements (menu)
- Slideshow/Carousel
- Team Carousel
- Timeline
